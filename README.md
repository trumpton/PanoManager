# PanoManager - Panorama Manager

This is a tool, built with QT that is used to manage panorama tours.
It loads equirectangular images, creates cube faces (which can then be annotated), and allows the interactive generation of tours. See the user manual, which can be found at http://www.trumpton.uk/panomanager. 

## Overview

A Tour contains:
* Scenes - A scene contains six cube-face images, and a number of nodes.
* Nodes - These can be links to other scenes, information points, or links to media files.

A tour is saved in a 'pmp' file.  Once complete, the tour can be exported to a folder, where the appropriate web files are created.

Tours can currently be created for 'Pannellum' and 'Marzipano', and a snapshot of the Pannellum and Marzipano built files are included (with links to get the latest versions directly).

Once exported, Pano Manager can launch a third-party web server (e.g. using php) so that the output can be viewed on a local disk, but using a web browser.

# Building

This program is written from Qt version 5.9.0 or above.
Open the .pro file in QtCreator and build.  If the build
folder is set to the same level as the 'lib' folder, the
debugger / application will be able to find the supporting
library files.
